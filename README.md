comments are added to code to aid understanding

in general, the computer uses tensor products to create its state, this is a vertical matrix.
this is then multiplied against the gate in matrix form and the output is a vector superposition of the states.
(assuming all gates have been run through) when output states contain a 1 we can call it a product state and our computation is finished
